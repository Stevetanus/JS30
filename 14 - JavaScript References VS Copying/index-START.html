      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      // You might think we can just do something like this:

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      const team = players.slice();
      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team2 = [].concat(players);
      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team3 = [...players];
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      const team4 = Array.from(players);
      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      const person2 = person;
      person.name = "Steven";
      console.log(person, person2);

      const nameArray = [
        ["Steven", "Thibe"],
        ["Tim", "Jimmy"],
      ];
      const nameArray2 = [...nameArray];
      nameArray2[0][0] = "Thibe";
      console.log(nameArray, nameArray2);

      // and think we make a copy:

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cp = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
      console.log(person, cp);
      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const cp2 = { ...person };
      console.log(cp2);
      cp2.age = 25;
      console.log(person, cp, cp2);
      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
